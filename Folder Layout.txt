Folder Layout

	The whole application is saved.  The files/folders below are the main ones for these to work.

- Gemfile - This file sets the dependencies and what needs to be installed to get things working.  When first downloading the project.  Ensure you run bundle install.  This will install all dependencies. 

app - \
			\ assets 
				- This location has all the CSS / Javascript / Images for the application
			\ controllers 
				- This has all the controllers for the applications.  Controllers control different segments of the program.  Each method has a view to display.  These are in plural form.
			\ helpers 
				- This folder has methods that could be used throughout the application.  Good location for a method that would be used multiple different components.
			\ models
				- Models interact with different parts of the database.  These have been created to validate and create the database tables.  The names are singular version of the data to be held.  
			\ views
				- These are the pages displayed to the user.  Segmented by names for the controller.  The name of the pages is based off the method from the controller

config - \
				\ routes.rb
					- This file controls the traffic of how the user does things
				\ database.yml
					- This file controls the connection to the database.  It is currently setup to connect to a posgresql database.  The credentials in this document are not what is used for production.  Running rails db:create, will create the databases set in this document.  

db 		- \ 
				\ migrate
					- The files in this folder create the database.  Running rails db:migrate, will create the tabels based off these files.
				\ seeds.rb
					- This file populates the database with data.  Normally data needed before using the application.  Running rails db:seed will run this file.  

test 		This folder is for setting automated testing for different functions.  What we want to test should have a method within one of the files within.

tmp 		This folder is just files that assist with that instance of the server.  This is good to clear every so often.

log			Any issues found, reported by rails can be found within here.  Very helpful if anything happens during production.
